Since having a son with severe autism, I have begun to research picture language technology, a technology that allows him to speak, and robotics technology, a technology that can take care of him for me after my death. I will make my research results available here. , I donâ€™t know that this wish can be realized in this life. Life is endless and hard work continues.
